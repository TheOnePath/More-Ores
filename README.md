## Creating an Issue
Before creating an issue, please confirm that this is occurring due to More Ores and not another mod, raising an issue about a bug that is not linked to More Ores will be ignored and redirection will be provided as best as possible.
If you believe that the issue is occuring with the mod, either the mod has been isolated and tested or due to cross-conflict, then please create an issue using the appropriate labels. Please use the minecraft version number (label '1.14.4') and bug (label 'bug') so bug issues can stand out from request issues that can also be created. Please put a non-ambiguous title about the bug and provide a description that best describes the issue that is occurring, please use pictures if they help emphasise the issue you are reporting and experiencing.

## Creating a Request
Requests can be made if you would like to see something implemented in a future release - please note that requests may never be implemented, however if you never suggest something, then it never will have a chance.
To create a request please use the 'request' label so that it stands out from the bug issues, use an appropriate title and provide a description that best suits the feature you'd like to be implemented - remember I cannot know exactly what it is you'd like to see.
